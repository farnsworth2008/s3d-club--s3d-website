# G001 Go Redirection 
This site has an associated site named `go.s3d.club` where we host a service we
provide for ourselves similar to [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com).

The reason we built this service was to help us write nicer markdown and easily
include links to various locations that often have very long URLs.

We also sometimes include links to our go site for content we have not yet
written but know will be needed. It's possible that you are arriving at this
page as the result of one of those links and if so please accept our
appologies; your link content will work once the associated content has been
written.

Our approach to documentation in our Terraform projects is a prime example of
how we use our go site for links. Usually we develop features first and when
doing so will write terraform documentation for our inputs or outputs that may
look like the following example.

```terraform
variable "cidr6s" {
  type = list(string)

  description = <<-END
    IP6 CIDRs
# highlight-next-line
    https://go.s3d.club/tf/ec2#cidr6s
    END
}
```

The example above was written as part of the `v0.1.x` release of our EC2
module. In our `v0.x` modules we often do not have very much documentation so
at the time the link was included in the Terraform code no page actually exist
for the link to go to and as such our service automatically routed people here
until the a page was written to describe the module.

## Implementation
In our implementation, we include path processing before and after map lookup
using javascript that is directly embeded on an index page that handles all
requests.

The code for the 

- `/` is replaced with `__`
- `-` is replaced with `_`
- `-/` is a split point. The string following `-/` will be a path for the
  target.

The following example shows all repacements.
- `https://go.s3d.club/example-multi/level-/docs/work/G001#we-like-short-urls`

The path processing produces the following.

```javascript
{
  key: "example_multi__level",
  path: "one/two/three-four#five"
}
```  

A javascript map on the `go.s3d.club` site has a sorted map with values for the
lookup keys.

```javascript
// The following map handles our url redirections
var map = {
  changes: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/notes/changes",
  example_multi__level: "https://www.s3d.club",
  go: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/work/G001#",
  todo: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/work/W001",
	farnsw__book: specEd,
	eks: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/source/aws-eks/overview",
	hc__aws: hcAwsRes,
}
```

The example produces a redirect to this page and others. Sith the logic we have
we are able to handle a lot of URLs without having a map entry for each URL
becauase in many cases the URLs we want to redirect are in groups and as such
we can use our `-/` split point feature to have one map entry redirect to a
group of pages on another site.

The full code for our implemenation is on our GitHub.

## We like short URLs!
Shorter URLs are easier to read, write, remember, and share. They look better
in markdown documents and are much easier to put into code when we want to
reference something. The [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com) site is nice but for
work inside our networks and for work on professional teams we don't want the
redirect handled by an external service.
