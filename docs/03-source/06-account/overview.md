# S3D AWS Account
## Overview
The source code of the S3D AWS Account project is here and open to public
inspection so it can act as an example project.

The code here **SHOUD NOT** contain anything that helps potential bad actors
obtain access to the site. If you are a reading our code in hopes of finding
out how to attack our site prepare to be disapointed.

In addition, the site has nothing on it that is not already open source and we
monitor the compute resources so if you do manage to get into our AWS account
you will not have access to anything of value and the account will be shutdown.

What we hope the code here will provide is an example that profesionals working
with AWS and Terraform can discuss as we seek to improve our craft.
