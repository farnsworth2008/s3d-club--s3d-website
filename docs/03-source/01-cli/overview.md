# S3D Club CLI
## Overview
The `s3d` CLI tool is inspired by the many other great CLI commands we use on a
daily basis. Our CLI is a useful day-to-day tool for working with AWS, GIT, GO,
Python, and a ton of other technologies. Like other parts of the S3D platform
the tool exists to share knowledge and provide a context where club members can
learn about technologies and participate in the development of the platform and
it's tools.

Our CLI is written in Go lang using
[spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra#overview). All commands have help
screens explaining what they do.
