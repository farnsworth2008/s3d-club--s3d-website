# Create an AWS Account 

Use the following link to establish an account on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- <https://aws.amazon.com/free>

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is a great platform where you can learn about
software developmment. We encurage you to explore features of AWS and
eventually other similar services on your own time.

The AWS _"Free"_ accounts are not really totally free and as such you will be
required to enter a credit card when you sign up for the service. As you work
through this tutorial you are not likely to encounter any charges but be aware
that you could create problems for yourself if you made outragous errors or
somehow accidentialy provide the credentials to your cloud computing account to
someone else. You may wish to use a pre-paid credit card or one with a very low
limit to protect yourself. You should also be sure to establish the account
with a strong password and read about the potential for AWS charges as you go
through the sign-up process.
