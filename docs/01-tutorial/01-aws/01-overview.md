# CloudShell Overview
In this tutorial, you will establish an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud
computing account.

This is a challenging tutorial but one that will put you on what we feel is the
correct path for building a career in software development.

We will start out using a tool called CloudShell.

The command line and script based environment of **modern** computing may seem
old fashion if you expect that this is a career where we use a mouse to click
and drag things around but trust use, these are critical skills to develop.

The **VIM** tool in particular will be strange if you have never worked with it
before but it is an amazing environment that you will hopefully learn to love.
Even if later you use other editing tools it is very important to gain an
understanding of how computing works in a unix envionment and VIM is usually
the default editor because it works so well for so many tasks.

This website is primarily built with the **VIM** editor and Markdown files
using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs).
