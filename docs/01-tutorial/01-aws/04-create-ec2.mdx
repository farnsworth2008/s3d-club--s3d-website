# Create an EC2 Instance

We will use a script to create our first EC2 instance.

It is important to understand that anytime you execute a script in cloudshell
the script operates with your credentials and as such you should be careful of
the scripts you execute.

Enter the following command to view the script without executing it.

```bash
cd ~/s3d-tutorial-start
vim ./scripts/create-ec2-instance
```

The script performs the following:

1. Creates an EC2 Key named "s3d-k1"
1. Creates a PEM file that allows you to access the instance via SSH
1. Creates an EC2 Security Group for SSH Access
1. Starts an EC2 instance

As you review the comments in the script using VIM you may with to use a search
engine such as Google to locate and review the associated AWS documentation.

Once you are comfortable with your understanding of the script execute it as
follows. (Remember to first exit VIM by typing `:` followed by `q`. Also, when
you type the Bash commands try using the `<tab>` key as you enter the command
_(i.e. `./scr<tab>/crea<tab>`)_.

```bash
./scripts/create-ec2-instance
```
## Use SSH to Access the EC2 instance

The Security Group we are using to run this instance allows anyone in the world
to attempt a connection provided they know the domain name that AWS has
randomly selected for the EC2 instance and provided they send appropiate key
information. The key information needed to establish the connection is saved in
our CloudShell home directory in PEM file format. The DNS Name of the instance
can be determined using the AWS CLI but only if the person issuing the commands
has an the appropiate authorization. You now have your own virtual machine that
runs in an AWS data center but this machine is secure provided you never share
the PEM file with anyone else.

We will use Vim to view a script that allows you to issue the SSH command. As
we mentioned earlier it is a good practice to understand the scripts you
execute. Since you will be executing this script in a CloudShell session you
want to be certain that you understand the commnads contained with the script.

To view the script issue the following command.

```bash
cd ~/s3d-tutorial-start
vim ./scripts/ssh-to-s3d
```

When you are comfortable with your understanding of the script, exit VIM execute
this script just like you executed the earlier one.

A welcome message will be displayed and your EC2 session will start. In future
tasks we will perform our work on the EC2 instance rather then directly using
CloudShell because this provides us the ability to customize our enviornment
and we can adjust the security priviliges within an EC2 instance to make it
safe for us to donwload and execute code. Although in this tutorial we
configure the EC2 instance with an adminstration level access key such a
practice should be avoided when working professionally.

In this case, you started your SSH session from your CloudShell session you can
do this in the future but it far better to connect directly using a personal
computer because alhough the web based interface to CloudShell works well there
are other options that provide a better experience. The exact way you establish
the connection will change depending on the type of computer you own but any
technique you use will require the PEM file so it is important that you
download it and keep it secure on your home computuer.

To download the PEM file, use the **Actions** menu of the CloudShare interface
and download the `~/.ssh/s3d-p1.pem` file. Store the file in an appropiate
location on your personal computer and use it to issue the same command you see
outputed when you run the `scripts/ssh-to-s3d` script.

## Install GIT on the EC2 Instance

The EC2 instance we created is at this point a basic server with only the
standard AWS provided tools. The GIT tool was available to us when we were
working on CloudShell but it has not yet been install on our new EC2 Instance.

The following command uses the [Yellow Dog Update
Manger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_(software)) to install the `git`. The
`git` program was pre-installed on the Cloudshell computer but the EC2 instance
we have created is a bare enviornment with very few tools pre-installed. We
like that the `yum` installer makes us think about food; it makes us smile and
then we think about a cute yellow dog.

```bash
sudo yum install git 
```

Git is a tool for managing source code.

In command above, we are issuing a `yum` package manager to perform the install
of the `git` package using `sudo` in order to allow the us to execute the
command with an elevated security level. The command `sudo` is a request for
the *super* user to *do* something.

With GIT installed you can now clone this repo on the EC2 instance.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s3d-club/s3d-tutorial-start.git
```
