My name is Mark; I am the first member of the club!

This is my first blog post for the [S3D](./) club.

The [S3D](./) club is a group of computer nerds. We exist to discuss software
development, exchange ideas, and share reusable projects.

The projects shared here are shared for the open source community and are fully
independent from our professional work.  The work shared via this club site is
not endorsed by our employers. The club exists simply as a way to share open
source projects, notes, and provide a context for discussion.

This club allows members to work in an open source space where we can use
software we develop in for personal and professionl projects.
